# fake-news-detection 
In this project, I took news data and applied passive aggressive classifier to detect fake news from articles. TfIdfVectorizer turns a collection of raw documents into a matrix of Tf-Idf features. Then I used the passive agressive classifier on the converted dataset and had an accuracy of 92%. I printed the confusion matrix where we can see that the model performance is pretty good at detecting false news. False positive and False negative values are minimal.
